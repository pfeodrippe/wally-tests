  ;; Click on a element.
  ;; We use garden selectors to do queries. In this case, we are querying (for clicking on it)
  ;; for the element that is an `a` and has a `href` pointing to the
  ;; `#applying-viewers` ID,  this element is in the ToC of the book of clerk (in the
  ;; sidebar).
  ;; In raw form, it's equivalent to `(s/selector "a[href=\"#applying-viewers\"]")`
  ;; (you can inspect the form built using the REPL!).
  ;; Check https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors and
  ;; https://cljdoc.org/d/garden/garden/1.3.10/doc/readme.

;; TODO
;; - [x] Check what's shown in the screen when clicking on some ToC header
;; - [ ] Make it run in the CI

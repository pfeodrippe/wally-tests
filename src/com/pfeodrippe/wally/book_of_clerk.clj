  ;; Navigate to a page.

  ;; Click on a element.
  ;; We use garden selectors to do queries. In this case, we are querying (for clicking on it)
  ;; for the element that is an `a` and has a `href` pointing to the
  ;; `#applying-viewers` ID,  this element is in the ToC of the book of clerk (in the
  ;; sidebar).
  ;; In raw form, it's equivalent to `(s/selector "a[href=\"#applying-viewers\"]")`
  ;; (you can inspect the form built using the REPL!).
  ;; Check https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors and
  ;; https://cljdoc.org/d/garden/garden/1.3.10/doc/readme.
  (w/click (s/a (s/attr= :href "#applying-viewers")))

  ;; After clicking above, we want to make sure that the right content is being
  ;; displayed in the browser viewport (which it's what the user sees while
  ;; scrolling through the page).

  (w/click (s/a (s/attr= :href "#recursion")))

  ;; This should fail now as the page scrolled until the Recursion section.
